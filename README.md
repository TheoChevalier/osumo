oSUMO
=====

oSUMO is an offline HTML5 application for [SUMO](https://github.com/mozilla/kitsune)
designed for Firefox OS, with added bonus of being a local application for
other browsers and clients.

Most of what is interesting is inside `/static`. The rest is used to serve
static html pages.

You can access it right now at at http://osumo.paas.allizom.org (though this is
probably very very outdated, if it works at all).

Requirements
============

This app targets Firefox, Firefox OS, and Firefox for Android. Other platforms
such as Chrome may work but is not guarenteed. Your browser must support
IndexedDB and appcache.

Hacking and Contributing
========================

Right now is probably not a good time to start hacking on this as most of
the code is highly experimental. I would suggest you wait and give feed back
on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=877311) until the
code base calms down.

Another part of this project also lives in
[kitsune](https://github.com/mozilla/kitsune). So take a look at that project
as well.
